# What is Douyu Play Pokermon?

  My project is starting a live channel on Douyu (chinese twitch). Normally, audiences send messages to the host for chatting. I want to use these messages as commands to control my computer to, for an example, play pokermon. This is not a new project. Researchers in Carnegie Mellon University started a live channel called “Twitch Play Pokermon” on twitch as a social experiment years ago and created a sensation on the Internet. I find this experiment excited and want to do the same thing.
